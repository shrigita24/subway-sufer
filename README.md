Project Overview This project enables users to control the popular game Subway Surfers using hand gestures. The system uses a webcam to capture real-time hand gestures, processes these gestures to recognize specific actions, and sends corresponding keyboard inputs to the game. This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision and human-computer interaction.

Features Hand Gesture Recognition: Uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to detect and recognize hand gestures.

Real-Time Processing: Processes video feed from a webcam in real-time.

Keyboard Simulation: Uses PyAutoGUI to simulate keyboard inputs based on recognized gestures.

Easy Setup: Simple to install and configure.

Requirements Python 3.x

OpenCV

Mediapipe

PyAutoGUI
